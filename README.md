## **Overview**
<p> 
The CDC has officially confirmed the first US case of the Omicron variant earlier this month and the urgency to reach the remaining 80 million unvaccinated Americans is back at the forefront. However, the sentiments of these individuals range from distrust to blind faith towards more holistic approaches against COVID-19 and thus, it might be relevant for government agencies to analyze the most candid sentiments of the public towards vaccines in order to vaccinate those who remain hesitant.<p/>

The fear of side effects and the desire to “wait and see if vaccines are safe” were cited as the top two concerns of a group of unvaccinated individuals that the Census Household Pulse surveyed in July of 2021. Given that enough time has passed since the vaccine roll outs occurred, it might be interesting to know if the perception of vaccines became more positive over time.<p/>
